\title{Check the data for kernel estimation}
\usage{
.prepareKernel(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  xgrid = NULL,
  bw = NULL,
  kernel = c("gaussian", "uniform", "triangular", "epanechnikov", "quartic"),
  order = 2,
  convolution = FALSE,
  PIT = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector, matrix, or data frame containing observations. For density, the
points used to compute the density. For kernel regression, the points corresponding to
explanatory variables.}

\item{y}{Optional: a vector of dependent variable values.}

\item{xgrid}{A vector or a matrix of data points with \code{ncol(xgrid) = ncol(x)}
at which the user desires to compute the weights, density, or predictions.
In other words, this is the requested evaluation grid.
If \code{NULL}, then \code{x} itself is used as the grid.}

\item{bw}{Bandwidth for the kernel: a scalar or a vector of the same length as \code{ncol(x)}.
Since it is the crucial parameter in many applications, a warning is thrown if the bandwidth
is not supplied, and then, Silverman's rule of thumb (via \code{bw.row()}) is applied
to *every dimension* of \code{x}.}

\item{kernel}{Character describing the desired kernel type (Gaussian is infinitely smooth but does not provide finite support).}

\item{order}{An integer: 2, 4, or 6. Order-2 kernels are the standard kernels that
are positive everywhere. Orders 4 and 6 produce some negative values, which reduces bias but may hamper density estimation.}

\item{convolution}{Logical: if FALSE, returns the usual kernel. If TRUE, returns
the convolution kernel that is used in density cross-validation.}

\item{PIT}{If TRUE, the Probability Integral Transform (PIT) is applied to all columns
  of \code{x} via \code{ecdf} in order to map all values into the [0, 1] range. May
  be an integer vector of indices of columns to which the PIT should be applied.

Note that if \code{pit = TRUE}, then the kernel-based weights become nearest-neighbour weights (i.e. not much different from the ones used
internally in the built-in \code{loess} function) since the distances now depend on the ordering of data, not the values per se.}
}
\description{
Checks if the order is 2, 4, or 6, transforms the objects into matrices to pass to the C++ functions,
checks the dimensions, provides the bandwidth etc.
